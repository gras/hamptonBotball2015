# hamptonBotball2015
This repository contains the movement and line following libraries I wrote for Hampton Botball in 2105. We went on to place 3rd overall at the global level, as well as first in the seeding rounds at the global level, and first overall at the regional level.

TL;DR the code works 

All notes required to get the library up and running are in the files as comments.
With this being said, there are a few things to keep in mind...

1) Make sure that the definitions at the top of each file match the correct ports on your robot

2) The line library pulls movement functions from the movment library, so if you want to use it, get both files

3) It is important to set all thresh values and globals for your specific robot. Pay attention to the coments with /// in front of them and you should have no problem doing this.
